# guardrail-washer-dashboard
The detecting system of the automatic highway guardrail washer (my intro to engineering project 2).

## Purpose

The project aims to make a machine that can clean the highway guardrail automatically. And the repo is responsible for the dashboard for detecting the working situation of the machine. What it can detects is

- Overview
- Location (by GPS module)
- Specific data with graph (unused finally)

## Packages

The website does not have a complete back-end. It is actually front-end project for demonstration. Hence, I use `bower` to deal with all the required packages. 

To install all the required packages, run
```
bower install
```

## Demo

Currently, the website is held on <http://washer.jasonqian.me>. The url is not guaranteed to be valid after the expo on Aug. 10, 2016.
